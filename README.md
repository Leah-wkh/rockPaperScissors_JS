# rockPaperScissors_JS

For this project, I created a Rock, Paper, Scissors game with Java Script. The program requires the user to enter either rock, paper, or scissors, then generates a random intiger to determine the computer's choice. 

Next the program uses if and else to compare the user's choice against the computer's choice, and select's the appropriate output depending on who won the game.
